Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

Could possibly use more commits. Need to add a README file.

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

indendtation on js page line 16 needs to be indented and lines 7, 10, 12, 15 don't need the spacing. Other than that legible.

Were branching and looping used effectively?

Branching and looping looks good. Good use of var, and if/else statements.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

Minimal bootstrap use. Used CSS to style HTML elements.

Is the site user-friendly?

Yeah - responsive. Maybe light font on dark background will be helpful (a little hard to read)
